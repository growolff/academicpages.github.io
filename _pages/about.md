Hello, I am Gonzalo Olave, Electrical Engineer and MSc. Student from the University of Chile.
I work in Robotics since 2011 in the UChile Homebrakers Team (see [Bender's Page](http://robotica-uchile.amtc.cl/bender-index.html)).
I've also worked in a few projects in the robotics laboratory [AMTC-DIE Robotics Lab](http://robotica-uchile.amtc.cl/).

I like teaching robotics, 3D modelling and printing. My hobbies are playing music, cyclism, reading and photograpy. Also, nowadays I'm very into ducks.

I ride an old road bike called 'Anacleto'. Its mainly made of steel and its strong and trustworthy. It takes me anyway I want to.
