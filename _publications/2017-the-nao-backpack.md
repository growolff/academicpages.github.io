title: "The NAO Backpack: An Open-hardware Add-on for Fast Software Development with the NAO Robot"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2017-the-nao-backpack
excerpt: 'We present an open-source accessory for the NAO robot, which enables
to test computationally demanding algorithms in an external platform while
preserving robot’s autonomy and mobility. The platform has the form of a
backpack, which can be 3D printed and replicated, and holds an ODROID XU4
board to process algorithms externally with ROS compatibility. We provide also
a software bridge between the B-Human’s framework and ROS to have access
to the robot’s sensors close to real-time. We tested the platform in several
robotics applications such as data logging, visual SLAM, and robot vision with
deep learning techniques. The CAD model, hardware specifications and software
are available online for the benefit of the community.'
